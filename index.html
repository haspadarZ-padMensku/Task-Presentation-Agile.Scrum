								Agile is not a Specific Way of Developing Software.
								Byt AGILE is the set of Values and Principles.
								The main four values are known as Agile Manifesto.
								Here are these values:
								1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
								2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
								3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
								4. Responding to change over following a plan

						<h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
						<img width="85%" height="85%" data-src="./img/agile-scrum-full-process.jpg" alt="agile-scrum-full-process">
						<aside class="notes">
								Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and supporting complex products.
								It is based on Agile values.
								At the picture we can see full cycle of Scrum development.
								First, the Product Owner collects all the necessary requirements for his product 
								and puts them in the Product Backlog. Then the team of developers plans the sprint 
								and selects some requirements that need to be done till the end of the Sprint. 
								During the Sprint the team makes Daily Scrum Meetings. 
								In the end of sprint the team delivers Done Increment of product. 
								Then the cycle is repeated.

							<h2>Three Whales</h2>
							<p>The scrum process is based on "Three Whales":</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Transparency</li>
								<li>Inspection</li>
								<li>Adaptation</li>
							</ul>
							<aside class="notes">
								Significant aspects of the process must be visible and understandable to those who responsible for the outcome.
								Participants of the Scrum process must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts to detect undesirable variances.
								If they determine that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, 
								and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process must be adjusted.

						<h2>Air Conditioner as an example</h2>
						<img width="70%" height="70%" data-src="./img/Air-Conditioner.jpg" alt="Air Conditioner">
						<aside class="notes">
								For example, air conditioning, works on these principles. 
								It regularly measures the temperature of the room (conducts an inspection) and, 
								if the temperature is above then nessecery, turns on the cooling mode (adapts). 
								The temperature sensor must work correctly to show the temperature (transparency).

								<h3>The Product Owner</h3>
								<p>The Product Owner is the only person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.</p>
								<p>The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.</p>
						</section>

						<section>
								<h3>The Development Team</h3>
								<p>The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially
										releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.</p>
						</section>

						<section>
								<p>Development Teams have the following characteristics:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team
											how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;</li>
									<li>Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a
											product Increment;</li>
								</ul>
						</section>

						<section>
								<ul>
									<li>Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team;</li>
									<li>Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but
											responsibility belongs to the Development Team as a whole.</li>

								<h4>The Sprint</h4>

							<p>The <strong style="color:limegreen">Increment</strong> is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the
									value of the increments of all previous Sprints.</p>
