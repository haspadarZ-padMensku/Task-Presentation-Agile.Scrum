						<h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
						<p>Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Scrum is:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Lightweight</li>
								<li>Simple to understand</li>
								<li>Difficult to master</li>
							</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
							<p>The essence of Scrum is a small team of people. 
								The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
							<h2>Three Whales</h2>
							<p>The scrum process is based on "Three Whales":</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Transparency</li>
								<li>Inspection</li>
								<li>Adaptation</li>
							</ul>
					</section>

						<h2>Air Conditioner as an example</h2>

					<section>
						<h2>Three Whales</h2>
						<p><strong>Transparency.</strong> Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those who responsible for the outcome.</p>
						<p><strong>Inspection.</strong> Participants of the Scrum process must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect
							undesirable variances.</p>
						<p><strong>Adaptation.</strong> If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable
								limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being
								processed must be adjusted.</p>

								<h3>The Scrum Team</h3>
								<p>The Scrum Team consists of a <strong style="color:limegreen">Product Owner, the Development Team, and the Scrum Master.</strong> </p>
								<img width="80%" height="80%" data-src="./img/scrum-team-1.png" alt="Scrum Team">
						</section>

						<section>
								<h3>The Product Owner</h3>
								<p>The Product Owner is the only person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.</p>
								<p>The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.</p>
						</section>

						<section>
								<h3>The Development Team</h3>
								<p>The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially
										releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.</p>
						</section>

						<section>
								<p>Development Teams have the following characteristics:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team
											how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;</li>
									<li>Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a
											product Increment;</li>
								</ul>
						</section>

						<section>
								<ul>
									<li>Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team;</li>
									<li>Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but
											responsibility belongs to the Development Team as a whole.</li>
								</ul>
						</section>

						<section>
							<p>Optimal Development Team size should be between 3 and 9.</p>

								<h3>The Scrum Master</h3>
								<p></p>
								<p>The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum.</p>
								<p>Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules,
										and values.</p>

								<h3>Scrum Events</h3>
								<h4>The Sprint</h4>
								<p>The heart of Scrum is a <strong style="color:limegreen">Sprint</strong>, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable,
										and potentially releasable product Increment is created.</p>
								<p class="fragment">Sprint contain and consist of:</p>

								<h3>Scrum Artifacts</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Product Backlog</li>
									<li>Sprint Backlog</li>
									<li>Increment</li>
								</ul>
						</section>

						<section>
							<p>The <strong style="color:limegreen">Product Backlog</strong> is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. </p>
							<p>The <strong style="color:limegreen">Sprint Backlog</strong> is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for
									delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.</p>
							<p>The <strong style="color:limegreen">Increment</strong> is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the
									value of the increments of all previous Sprints.</p>
