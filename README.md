## Agile & Scrum

Hello everyone. Today I'm gonna tell you about Agile and Scrum. Wherever you worked you've faced with problem of inefficient work management. Agile and Scrum are one of the ways to properly manage the work process.

## What is Agile?

Agile is not a Specific Way of Developing Software. But AGILE is the set of Values and Principles. The main four values are known as Agile Manifesto. Here are these values:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over scheduled contract meetings
4. Responding to change over following a plan

Any development process built according to Agile values and principles is Agile development.

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and supporting complex products. It is based on Agile values.
At the picture we can see full cycle of Scrum development. First, the Product Owner collects all the necessary requirements for his product and puts them in the Product Backlog. Then the team of developers plans the sprint and selects some requirements that need to be done till the end of the Sprint. During the Sprint the team makes Daily Scrum Meetings. Progress is tracked using a burndown/up charts. In the end of sprint the team delivers "Done" Increment of the product. Then the cycle is repeated.

## Three Whales

The scrum process is based on "Three Whales":

- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation

Transparency means that significant aspects of the process must be visible and understandable to those who responsible for the outcome.

Inspection means thatparticipants of the Scrum process must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts to detect undesirable variances.

Adaptation means that if they determine that one or more aspects of a process lead to undesirable consequences, the process must be adjusted.

## Air Conditioner as an example

For example, air conditioning, works on these principles. It regularly measures the temperature of the room (Inspection) and, if the temperature is above then nessecery, turns on the cooling mode (Adaptation). The temperature sensor must work correctly to show the temperature (Transparency).

## The Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and the Scrum Master.

## The Product Owner 

The Product Owner is the only person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.

## The Development Team

The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

Development Teams have the following characteristics:

- They are self-organizing. No one tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
- Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills necessary to create a product Increment;
- Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team;
- The responsibility belongs to the Development Team as a whole, even if only person fails.

The essence of Scrum is a small team of people. The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive.

Optimal Development Team size is between 3 and 9 people.

## The Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.

## Scrum Events

The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.

Sprint consist of:
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review<
- Sprint Retrospective

Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something.

## Scrum Artifacts

- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Increment

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product.

The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.

The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, now you know the basic things about Agile Scrum development and understand what is imagined at this picture. Thank you for your time.
